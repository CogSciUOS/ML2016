To acquire the admission for the final exam, you will have to pass $N-2$ of the weekly provided exercise sheets.\n",

To be able to run these on your system, you will need to install Python and a few packages. We suggest you to use the latest version of Python 3. In case you are not familiar with it, follow the directives below ([Exersice 0a)](#a%29-Install-Python)) to get it up and running. [Exersice 0b)](#b%29-Run-Jupyter-Notebooks) on this sheet will provide details on how to run the notebooks with Jupyter.\n",
