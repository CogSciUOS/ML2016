# Machine Learning Sheets

This repository contains exercise sheets and example solutions for the course
Machine Learning. They will be updated along the course during each summer
semester.

The sheets were originally created during the summer semester 2016 but will be
updated along each semester.


# Old semesters

After each semester the final state will be tagged (see [releases](releases)),
so one can easily get the exercise sheets from one year or another by either
downloading the archives or just checking out the appropriate semester.
For example `git checkout SS16` will take you to the version from summer
semester 2016.

The master branch always reflects the latest state.


# For Tutors/Maintainers

To create a tag after the end of a semester, use the following syntax:

```
git tag SS16
git push origin SS16
```

You can then update the release page with the new tag.
