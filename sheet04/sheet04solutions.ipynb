    "In this assignment you will calculate the update rules for a Gaussian Mixture model required for the M-step of the EM algorithm. The Gaussian Mixture model can be used for soft clustering since it allows us to express varying degrees of certainty about the membership of individual samples. It is one of the most widely used models since Gaussian distributions generally have the property of fitting all different kinds of data reasonably well.\n",

We can now choose distributions for $p_k$ and $\\pi_k$ and we get a whole collection full of different possible models, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages (you can check <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model'>Wikipedia</a> if you want an overview). The easiest case is where our mixing distributions are normally distributed, $p_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_k,\\sigma_k)$, and our latent class probabilities have a discrete distribution where we only have $\\pi_k \\in [0,1]$ and the constraint $\\sum_k\\pi_k=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to randomly pick values for the coefficient vector $\\theta$ then we would now have a generative model that can produce naturally clustered data for us, we would just have to sample $x \\sim p(\\mathbf{x}_i|\\mathbf{\\theta})$. However, we want to go into the opposite direction and figure out what the distribution of the labels given the data is. This can be calculated easily by Bayes' Theorem:\n",

    "That sounds good enough, but where do we actually start now? We have a mathematical framework pinned down, but it contains many variables and it is not *a priori* obvious how we can figure out the best values for them. We *have* some data which we want to use to determine the parameters so the usual approach would be to simply calculate a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) or an Maximum A Posteriori Estimator (MAP) by maximizing the above formulas over the possible parameters with a method like Gradient Descent. It turns out however that this is very, very hard to do (optimal MLE for a GMM is NP-hard (Aloise et al. 2009; Drineas et al. 2004)) since the $\\pi_k$ and the $\\theta$ are strongly interdependent and neither is known. It *can* still be done with some work-arounds, but there is also an alternative path that we can go down."
