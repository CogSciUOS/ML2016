    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will calculate the update rules for a Gaussian Mixture model required for the M-step of the EM algorithm. The Gaussian Mixture model can be used for soft clustering since it allows us to express varying degrees of certainty about the membership of individual samples. It is one of the most widely used models since Gaussian distributions generally have the property of fitting all different kinds of data reasonably well.\n",

    "This means that the probability of observing a dataset $\\mathbf{x}$ given the parameter vector $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ can be expressed as the sum of $K$ individual distributions $p_k$ with parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta}_k \\subseteq {\\theta}$ which are weighted by respective class probabilities $\\pi_k$. The probability for individual data $x_i \\in \\textbf{x}$ is calculated correspondingly (note however, that of course the values for individual data differs from the overall probability). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now choose distributions for $p_k$ and $\\pi_k$ and we get a whole collection full of different possible models, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages (you can check <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model'>Wikipedia</a> if you want an overview). The easiest case is where our mixing distributions are normally distributed, $p_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_k,\\sigma_k)$, and our latent class probabilities have a discrete distribution where we only have $\\pi_k \\in [0,1]$ and the constraint $\\sum_k\\pi_k=1$.\n",

However, we want to go into the opposite direction and figure out what the distribution of the labels given the data is. This can be calculated easily by Bayes' Theorem for each model $k$, where the (latent) probability for choosing model $k$ is $p(k|\\mathbf{\\theta}_k) = \\pi_k$:\n",

    "That sounds good enough, but where do we actually start now? We have a mathematical framework pinned down, but it contains many variables and it is not *a priori* obvious how we can figure out the best values for them. We *have* some data which we want to use to determine the parameters so the usual approach would be to simply calculate a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) or an Maximum A Posteriori Estimator (MAP) by maximizing the above formulas over the possible parameters with a method like Gradient Descent. It turns out however that this is very, very hard to do (optimal MLE for a GMM is NP-hard (Aloise et al. 2009; Drineas et al. 2004)) since the $\\pi_k$ and the $\\theta_k$ are strongly interdependent and neither is known. It *can* still be done with some work-arounds, but there is also an alternative path that we can go down."
