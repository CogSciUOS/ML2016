    "\n",
    "Last week you implemented a simple perceptron. We discussed that one can use multiple perceptrons to build a network. This week you will build your own MLP. Again the following code cells are just a guideline. If you feel like it, just follow the algorithm steps and implement the MLP yourself."

    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following you will be guided through implementing an MLP step by step. Instead of sticking to this guide, you are free to take a complete custom approach instead if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a bottom-up approach: Starting from an individual **perceptron** (aka neuron), we will derive a **layer of perceptrons** and end up with a **multilayer perceptron** (aka neural network). Each step will be implemented as its own python *class*. Such a class defines a type of element which can be instantiated multiple times. You can think of the relation between such instances and their designated classes as individuals of a specific population (e.g. Bernard and Bianca are both individuals of the population mice). Class definitions contain methods, which can be used to manipulate instance of that class or to make it perform specific actions — again, taking the population reference, each mouse of the mice population would for example have the method `eat_cheese()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guide you along, all required classes and functions are outlined in valid python code with extensive comments. You just need to fill in the gaps. For each method the [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring) (the big comment contained by triple quotes at the beginning of the method) describes the arguments that specific method accepts (`Args`) and the values it is expected to return (`Returns`)."

    "### Perceptron\n",
    "Similar to last week you here need to implement a perceptron. But instead of directly applying it, we will define a class which is reusable to instantiate an theoretically infinite amount of individual perceptrons. We will need the following three functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weight initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are initialized by sampling values from a standard normal distribution. There are as many weights as there values in the input vector and an additional one for the perceptron's bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward-Propagation / Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the weighted sums of a neuron's inputs and apply it's activation function $\\sigma$. The output vector $o$ of perceptron $j$ of layer $k$ given an input $x$ (the output of the previous layer) in a neural network is given by the following formula. Note: $N$ gives the number of values of a given vector, $w_{j,0}(k)$ specifies the bias of perceptron $j$ in layer $k$ and $w_{j,1...N(x)}(k)$ the other weights of perceptron $j$ in layer $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$o_{k,j}(x) = \\sigma\\left(w_{j,0}(k)+\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N(x)} x_i w_{j,i}(k)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the weights $w(k)$ as a matrix being located in-between layer $k$ and the layer located *to its left* in the network. So values flowing from layer $k-1$ to layer $k$ are weighted by the values of $w(k)$. As activation function we will use the sigmoid function because of its nice derivative (needed later):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\sigma(x) &= \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp{(-x)}}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}(x) &= \\sigma(x) * (1 - \\sigma(x))\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Back-Propagation / Adaptation\n",
    "In order to learn something the perceptron needs to slowly adjust its weights. Each weight $w_{j,i}$ in layer $k$ is adjusted by a value $\\Delta w_{j,i}$ given a learning rate $\\epsilon$, the previous layer's output (or, for the first hidden layer, the network's input) $o_{k-1,i}(x)$ and the layer's error signals $\\delta(k)$ (which will be calculated by the MultilayerPerceptron):\n",

During training the model sometimes gets stuck in local minimum for a long time -- we could not figure out an easy way to get around this yet. Another problem with our training approach is that we do train on the complete dataset without a training/evaluation split! Another possible enhancement would be \"early stopping\": Instead of using the final state of the network for our evaluation, we could use the one which got the best max accuracy by saving it during training."

    "This exercise is aimed at deepening the understanding of Radial Basis Function Networks and how they relate to Multilayer Perceptrons. Not all of the answers can be found directly in the slides - so when answering the (more algorithmic) questions, first take a minute and think about how you would go about solving them and if nothing comes to mind search the internet for a little bit. If you are interested in a real life application of both algorithms and how they compare take a look at this paper: [Comparison between Multi-Layer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Networks for Sediment Load Estimation in a Tropical Watershed](http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JWARP20121000014_80441700.pdf)\n",
