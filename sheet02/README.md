This week's exercise sheet relies completely on Jupyter. If you did not install it yet, check last week's exercise sheet for instructions.

Just a quick recap to get you started:

  * Open a command window (Windows: Click on `start`, type `cmd.exe`, Mac: terminal.app)
  * Use the `cd FOLDER` (*change directory*) command to get to your working directory, meaning the directory where you placed the files from studip, including this *readme*.
  * Execute `jupyter notebook`. A browser window will open and you should see the actual exercise file.
